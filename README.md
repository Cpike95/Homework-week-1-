# Homework-week-1-

For the week one home work we were assigned the task of refactoring completed code to improve a clients codebase for long term sustainabilit and: 

1. Ensure that all links are functioning correctly
2. Clean up the CSS to make it more efficient, consolidating CSS selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements.
3. Including comments before each element or section of the page.

To the best of my ability I have completed the assignment.
